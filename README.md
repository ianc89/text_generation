Studies into LSTM for text generation

This repository is to build on studies performed on the char-rnn type setups.
I am interested in establishing my own simple LSTM/RNN type network which can learn text and generate something which looks like real English.
There are char-rnn tools out there, written in torch or other languages. I wish to build on tutorials for something with keras which I understand as fully as possible.

Ultimately, I would like to explore exporting a model into an XCode compatible format for iOS development in my spare time.
